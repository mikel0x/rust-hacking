# Rust – Day 2 (June 5, 2025)

## What I did
- Finished Chapter 2 of *The Rust Book*
- Wrote and executed the full *Guessing Game* project
- Used an external crate (`rand`) via Cargo
- Compiled and ran everything successfully

## Key Concepts Learned
- `let` and `mut` variables
- Reading user input with `std::io`
- Matching and comparing values using `match` and `Ordering`
- Using `loop` to create a game loop
- How to include and manage dependencies with Cargo

## Insights
It was fun to explore how Rust works, even as a complete beginner who initially struggled with some of the concepts. I really appreciated how Rust enforces impeccable syntax—it helped me avoid a lot of mistakes.

Another thing I really liked was the helpfulness of the error messages. They were reall clear, which made learning easier.

## Doubts / To review
- Still not 100% clear on how `match` works behind the scenes
- Want to understand more about how Cargo pulls crates from crates.io

## Next Steps
- Chapter 3 of *The Rust Book* tomorrow
- Start writing my own version of the game with a twist (maybe more tries or difficulty levels)
