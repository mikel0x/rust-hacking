## What is this?

In this repository I will be documenting my personal journey to master:
- Rust programming
- Offensive security (Web2, bug bounty, exploitation)
- Advanced tooling & custom scripts

Every log, experiment and tool I build will live here.

## Structure

- `/logs/` – daily progress notes
- `/tools/` – custom exploits, scripts, tools in Rust
- `/writeups/` – CTFs, labs, vulnerable apps
- `/notes/` – summarized learnings (Rust, OWASP, etc.)
